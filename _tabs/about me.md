- I was born in Mexico City, but moved to Woburn, MA when I was young
- Due to an early fascination with video games, I eventually found a love for the hardware that ran them!
- In high school, I loved to tear apart old laptops and some of my game consoles and getting a look at the components inside.
- This is what led me to study Computer Engineering at Boston Univerity
- Now, I have a passion for both messing around with hardware and creating spagetti code to run on it, and am excited to put my skills to use!
