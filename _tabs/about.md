- I was born in Mexico City, but moved to Woburn, MA when I was young
- Due to an early fascination with video games, I eventually found a love for the hardware that ran them!
- This is what led me to study Computer Engineering at Boston Univerity
- Now, I have a passion for both hardware and software, and am excited to put my skills to use!
