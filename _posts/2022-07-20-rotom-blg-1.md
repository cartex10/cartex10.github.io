<h5> Finally, after a few weeks of struggling to update 2 year old code, I was finally able to update RotomBot to Discord.py v2.0. Honestly, I wouldn't have bothered as long as it kept running like it had, but I also wanted to add a new command. In order to add what ended up being like a 6 line command, I had to essentially rewrite ALL of rotomBot.py. Good thing I finished it's write-up last week right? Anyway, Discord.py v2.0 is much better structured (even though I couldn't get Cogs to work), and any future changes will be easy to make. I kind of hope this is the last update for RotomBot, although I of course still want to maintain it, I also want to move on onto more interesting, larger scale, and productive projects. </h5>

<h5> The whole reason I underwent the ordeal of updating RotomBot is to implement a SICK Button. Quick explanation of what SICK (Server ID Change Kontest) is, basically, every once in a while, my friends and I like to change the appearance of our discord server through contest. In order to decide when to run the contest, I wanted to implement a button that people can press to show interest in running SICK. After the specified amount of people press the button, the bot pings everyone so we can manually run the contest. Maybe one day I can make it so RotomBot also semi-regularly reminds everyone during the week to submit entries, but again, I'm hoping to take a break from RotomBot. </h5>
