## Overview
<h5> This is a project that I've been planning for a while now, and incorporates all of what I've learned in the last four years. The goal of this project is to design, code and build a functional pocket assistant/friend, RoboDachi, named after Tomodachis, which inspired the idea for this project. This is a massive project for me, as it involves not just coding, but also pcb design, 3D printing, microcontrollers with components completely new to me, and creating a custom graphics library. I'm hoping to make big projects by the end of Summer 2022, but am expecting to be putting a lot of work in this for a long time. </h5>

## Project Purpose
<h5> This project is one of my babies. I know that sounds weird but hear me out. If successful, RoboDachi will be a completely custom design that I had a hand in working on every single part of, and will not only be a fun toy to play with, but may even help my overall productivity if I can connect it to MiniBot's (post to come) notifications. What I'm saying is, this is a lifelong project, that I'm not only excited to see what form it ends up in, but the journey I took to get it there, blood, sweat and tears included. </h5>
