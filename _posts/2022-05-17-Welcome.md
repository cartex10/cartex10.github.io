<h2> Hello, and Welcome to my site!</h2>
<h5> I hope you'll enjoy your time here, and are interested in the projects I've worked on! </h5>
<h5> I am not going to be very serious throughout my posts, and hope that you're not expecting too many serious or "professional" projects. I usually work on stuff that I think is an interesting concept, and is something that will benefit me or be fun to work on. </h5>
<h5> Here's a few projects I'm particularly proud of if you want some good stuff to check out first </h5>
- <a href="https://cartex10.github.io/posts/fightboard-v2/"> Fightboard v2 </a>
- <a href="https://cartex10.github.io/posts/vetcon/"> VETCON Badge </a>
- <a href="https://cartex10.github.io/posts/robodachi/"> RoboDachi </a>
<h5> This site is still very much a work in progress, so I recommend checking out my <a href="https://github.com/cartex10">GitHub page</a> and checking out each repo separately. </h5>
