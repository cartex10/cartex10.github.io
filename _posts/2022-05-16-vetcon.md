## Overview
<h5> This project was assigned to me as my Senior Design Project, and was completed alongside 4 other teammates. This project was much larger in scope than any other project I had ever done, but it was extremely rewarding putting all of the knowledge I have learned over the last 4 years, while also continuing to learn even more along the way. The job assigned to us by our client, VETCON, was to design an electronic badge for them to bring as their unique badge for DEFCON 2022, which is a convention for "security professionals" and "not hackers" to come together and spread their knowledge. </h5>

<h5>The main language used for the project was C++, with some javascript used for some of the games, and the microcontroller at the heart of all of our hardware was the MSP430. I've already written enough reports throughout the last two semesters, so check the <a href="https://github.com/derekbarbosa/EC463">Project GitHub</a> for any more info. </h5>


## Project Purpose
<h5> At first, I expected this project to be similar to <a href="https://cartex10.github.io/ec444/ec444">EC444</a>, a class based entirely around working with microcontrollers and compatible components, but we were challenged along the entire project. Whether screens were compatible, or whether we could get the device to print to the console successfully and consistently, the hardware challenged us constantly. Not only that, completely new challenges were thrown upon us too, such as designing a completely custom PCB, which ended up becoming my job. This was one of a few challenges we faced that we had little experience with, but I'm glad to say that it was absolutely worth it, and I've obtained new skills I'll definitely use in the future.</h5>
